## Inspiration

2020 is the year of Covid-19, causing much stress to everyone, from loss of lives, loss of jobs/income, to home quarantines and much unhappiness.

There is an urgent need to give more attention to detection of depression, and provide help as soon as possible.

## What it does

This web app will read the user input, and provide a simple sentiment analysis of the user's state of happiness.

## How I built it

This project was built with PyTorch using LSTM model, and Flask as backend, for the Data Native Unlimited hackathon 2020 [dn-unlimited-hackathon.devpost.com](https://dn-unlimited-hackathon.devpost.com).
